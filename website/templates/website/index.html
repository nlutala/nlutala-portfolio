            I aspire to pursue a career in the technology industry. Apart from the industry revolving around efficient
            algorithm use and problem-solving, it is also centred on learning, which I find enjoyable. The exposure to
            learning music formally in secondary school has led me to teach myself how to play the keyboard and other
            instruments in my free time. In the same
            way, Computer Scientists are continuously learning as they are always searching for more efficient
            algorithms for our mundane problems. Throughout this ongoing experience, I have realised that learning is
            not limited to acquiring more knowledge; it also includes finding ways to use your skills and experiences to
            achieve something different. I hope to continue this journey and have more opportunities to grow
            holistically throughout my career.

            <p>
              While studying Computer Science at university, I was lucky to have
              the chance to work in the digital marketing industry with
              programmatic direct mail. I worked part-time as an Operations
              Developer, where my role was mainly as a mentor, guiding Junior
              Operations Developers on how to set up campaigns and their
              maintenance. As an Operations Developer, I successfully assisted my
              mentees in launching postal marketing campaigns for six clients.

            <p>
              Before this, I was a Junior Operations Developer in a position
              similar to the intelligent and motivated people I mentored during my
              industrial placement. Here, I:

              <ul>
                <li>
                  Collaborated with a cross-functional team to conceptualize and
                  implement a new campaign type for the company.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Used and developed my skills in HTML, CSS and JavaScript
                  (Angular.js) to contribute to a local template to create direct
                  mail marketing templates
                </li>
                <li>
                  Enhanced a Shopify API hook using C# to increase customer
                  segmentation for approximately 11% of the client base
                </li>
                <li>
                  Created an automation tool using Python and collaborated with
                  other developers to make use of AWS Services including AWS 
                  Lambda, AWS CodePipeline and AWS CodeCommit, to streamline the
                  management of weekly invoices and increase productivity by 50%
                  (decreased a process that was previously 4 hours to 2 hours)
                </li>
                <li>
                  Developed an automated email alerting system to assist with

            <p>
              I recently completed the Internship Experience UK (IEUK) Technology
              programme, a four-day virtual experience hosted by Bright Network.
              Many students and recent graduates like myself had the opportunity
              to listen to professionals in the technology industry working at
              world-renowned companies with the likes of PwC, Deloitte, BT Group,
              Lloyds Banking Group and more about having and demonstrating
              leadership skills, building transferable skills and a professional
              brand. Many speakers from these companies shared their experiences
              and discussed the new initiatives under development at their
              companies. We had a work sample to complete the last two days of
              the programme, which gave us insight into project management.

              Harmony Hackathon, Runner-up - June 2024
            </h3>
            <p>
              I attended my first-ever hackathon with no expectations and managed
              to win runner-up with a great team. This hackathon aimed to look
              into how different aspects of
              <a href="https://harmonydata.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Harmony</a>
              could be improved. What the teams looked into could be an issue from
              the list on the
              <a href="https://github.com/harmonydata/hackathon/blob/main/README.md"
                target="_blank">GitHub repository</a> for the competition.
            </p>
            <p>
              My team took on a UX approach in this hackathon, looking for ways to
              tackle how Harmony could potentially compare the similarity between
              three or more questionnaires or surveys (as Harmony was limited to
              two studies at the time).
