            I aspire to pursue a career in the technology industry. Apart from the industry revolving around efficient
            algorithm use and problem-solving, it is also centred on learning, which I find enjoyable. The exposure to
            learning music formally in secondary school has led me to teach myself how to play the keyboard and other
            instruments in my free time. In the same
            way, Computer Scientists are continuously learning as they are always searching for more efficient
            algorithms for our mundane problems. Throughout this ongoing experience, I have realised that learning is
            not limited to acquiring more knowledge; it also includes finding ways to use your skills and experiences to
            achieve something different. I hope to continue this journey and have more opportunities to grow
            holistically throughout my career.

            While studying Computer Science at university, I was lucky to have the chance to work in the digital
            marketing industry with programmatic direct mail. I worked part-time as an Operations Developer, where my
            role was mainly as a mentor, guiding Junior Operations Developers on how to set up campaigns and their
            maintenance. As an Operations Developer, I successfully assisted my mentees in launching postal marketing
            campaigns for six clients.</br></br>

            Before this, I was a Junior Operations Developer in a position similar to the intelligent and motivated
            people I mentored during my industrial placement. Here, I: <br><br>

            <ul>
              <li>Collaborated with a cross-functional team to conceptualize and implement a new campaign type for the
                company.</li>
              <li>Used and developed my skills in HTML, CSS and JavaScript (Angular.js) to contribute to a local
                template to create direct mail marketing templates</li>
              <li>Enhanced a Shopify API hook using C# to increase customer segmentation for approximately 11% of the
                client base</li>
              <li>Created an automation tool using Python and collaborated with other developers to make use of AWS
                Services including AWS Lambda, AWS Codepipeline and AWS CodeCommit, to streamline the management of
                weekly invoices and increase productivity by 50% (decreased a process that was previously 4 hours to 2
                hours)</li>
              <li>Developed an automated email alerting system to assist with account reconciliation using T-SQL</li>

            I attended King's College London to obtain a BSc in Computer Science with a year in industry. I was also
            awarded the Associate of King's College London (AKC) certification, through a course designed for students
            to develop an enquiring mind and learn about topics beyond their field of study.
